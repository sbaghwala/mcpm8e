Agentic RAG for Enterprise Migration Projects
Context
Migration Project: Core banking system migrating from COBOL/CICS/DB2 mainframe to Java Spring Boot on AWS - 30% complete, 70% remaining.
Problem Statement
Challenge: Enterprise migration projects suffer from:

Knowledge Fragmentation: Critical decisions and solutions scattered across hundreds of documents
Repetitive Research: Teams waste 40% of time re-answering solved problems
Decision Delays: Lack of real-time insights on modern tools vs traditional approaches
Inconsistent Patterns: Same mistakes repeated across different migration phases

Agentic RAG Solution
Traditional RAG: Migration Knowledge Assistant

Instant access to past architectural decisions, code patterns, and troubleshooting solutions
Natural language queries return specific examples with document citations
Eliminates time spent searching through technical documentation

Agentic Component: AI Tool Advisor

Real-time intelligence on latest AWS AI/ML migration tools
Cost-benefit analysis: manual approach vs AI-assisted conversion
Live recommendations based on current project context and requirements

Demo Scenarios
Query 1: "How did we solve database connection timeouts in batch processing?"
→ Returns specific configuration fixes with performance data
Query 2: "Should we use AWS CodeWhisperer for remaining COBOL conversions?"
→ Provides real-time cost analysis, accuracy comparison, and implementation roadmap
Bottom Line: Transform static project knowledge into intelligent, actionable guidance that accelerates delivery and reduces risk.
